# Instructions

We will now use a new principle : the interfaces.

Let's create an interface `Tank` in a file `Tank.java`.
It has one method : `getShield` that returns an integer.

Create another interface `Healer` in a file `Healer.java`. It has two methods : 
* `heal` which takes a `Character` as parameter and return nothing.
* `getHealCapacity` which returns an integer.
